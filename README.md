String Tokenizer Class
======================

# Problem 
You need to break a string into pieces using a set of delimiters. 

# Solution 
Use the **find_first_of** and **first_first_not_of** member functions on **basic_string**
to iterate through the string and alternately locate the next tokens and non-tokens.
